# After Effects Workflow Scripts

A variety of Adobe After Effects workflow scripts. The scripts are designed to
be used with keyboard shortcuts (examples of how to do this are found in the
Adobe After Effects [ver] Win en_US Shortcuts.txt file). Most of the scripts are
geared towards working with stock video, which involves working with many
near-identical Comps containing short, discrete video clips.
